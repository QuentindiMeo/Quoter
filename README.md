Welcome to the Quoter program!<br>
<br>
I had a couple of hours of spare time during 2020 summer holidays so I decided to make this. :D<br>
This program aims to be a quotes dispenser. With or without parameters, it'll print a quote it picked in a file.<br>
Discover how the program works by typing './quoter --help'.<br>

Have fun!<br>
